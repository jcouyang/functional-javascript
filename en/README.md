# Functional JavaScript
[![Build Status](https://www.gitbook.io/button/status/book/jcouyang/functional-javascript)](https://www.gitbook.io/book/jcouyang/functional-javascript/activity)

This tiny book may only take you 2 hours to read, but it may take you to a journey of experiencing almost all the functional way of writing code in JavaScript. And It will cover some of the new feature come with ECMAScript 6 like arrow function, pattern matching etc. Further more, I will list the implementations of some fancy typeclasses from Haskell in JavaScript.

If you're kind of:

Plz read [Learn JavaScript](https://www.gitbook.io/book/gitbookio/javascript) first, but you're just like:

![](/en/images/function inside function.jpg)

this book may help you understand that at some point.

I chose [Eweda](https://rawgit.com/CrossEye/eweda/master/docs/eweda.html) as functional library for almost all examples.

> **Comment** Eweda is more academic version of [Ramda](https://rawgit.com/CrossEye/ramda/master/docs/ramda.html)

> **Comment**[Why not Underscore](http://fr.umio.us/why-ramda/) Short story: no auto curry. Long story: checkout chapter 2.

> **Note** In case I will write some code in ECMAScript 6 or (draft) standard, you better use firefox to run all those (who looks weird) examples. Simply tell what feature your browser has implement [here](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)). Anyway, most long example will be followed by a jsbin.


If you're not feeling right about any of my point of view, just post issue or pull request to me.
